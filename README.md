# ML_connect_four
Practicing machine learning by training a neural network to play connect four

##Next task (So, 16.06.2019, 20:00)
Write a player class with a neural network brain
- The player takes the game state as an input and gives the next move as
an output (which column to play in)


## Next task (We, 23.05.2019, 20:00)
Write a neural network class with the following properties:
- The neural network can feed forward
- You can set the inputs
- You can read the outputs
- You can set the weights
- You can set the number of input neurons, hidden neurons and output neurons
- There is one hidden layer
- The neurons use a sigmoid function as their activation function
- The activation function must be easily replaceable
